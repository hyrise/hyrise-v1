JSON Query Execution
********************

#. Set up where to look for table data directory (folder already exists) ::

      cd hyrise
      export HYRISE_DB_PATH=`pwd`/test

#. Export library directory ::

      export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./build/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

#. Starting the server :: 

      ./build/hyrise_server -l ./build/log.properties -p 5000

#. Now in a different terminal, you can send a query to the server ::

       curl -X POST --data-urlencode query@test/gettingstarted.json --data performance=true
       http://localhost:5000/jsonQuery

Details
=======

JSON Queries are a different representation of the original flow graph
of the query plan. Basically a k-v map defines all operators that are
connected using edges. An example for a simple query plan is defined
below::

    { 
        "papi": "PAPI_L1_DCA",
        "operators" : {
            "0": {
                "type": "TableLoad",    
                "table": "ADRC",
                "header": "ADRC_header_1.txt",
                "filename" : "ADRC.data" 
            },
            "1" : {
                "type" : "SimpleTableScan",
                "positions" : true,
                "predicates":[
                { "type": 7 },
                { "type" : 1, "in" : 0, "f" : "NAME1", "vtype" : 0, "value": 330 }, 
                { "type" : 1, "in" : 0, "f" : "NAME2", "vtype" : 0, "value": 300 }
                ]
            },
            "2" : {
                "type" : "ProjectionScan",
                "fields" : [
                "ADDRNUMBER","NAME_CO","NAME1","NAME2" 
                ]
            }
        },
        "edges": [["0","1"],["1","2"]]
    }

The HYRISE HTTP interface accepts additional parameters through data
params, in this example, we set `performance` as `true` so we will
receive extra performance data in the response. Any other value for
`performance` (or no value at all) will lead to performance data not
being send back to the client.


Parameters
==========

The JSON input document defines 3 main input keys

#. ``papi`` - Any valid PAPI event name that is available on this  machine. Currently there are always two events captured during the  plan execution ``PAPI_TOT_CYC`` and the additional event.
#. ``operators`` - A map of keys and values representing the different operators. The key is later referenced to perform dependency detection.
#. ``edges`` - The edges define the actual flow graph. Dependencies are listed as pairs of operators. There is only one special case  where only one plan operator is given, than a circular edge is given  ``["0", "0"]``.

The edges of the flow graph may describe any non-circular graph with the restriction that any vertice may have multiple inputs, but only a single output.

With this particular JSON Query, Hyrise Server would perform three Database Operations. 
First on the "Edge" ["0","1"] a table is being loaded into the database from file (operator: "0"). A SimpleTableScan is then being performed on that table (operator: "1"), giving predicates for the selection in prefix notation. The example above would translate to: (company_id > 2) OR (company_name = "Microsoft"). See :ref:`simpleTableScan` for more details on the SimpleTableScan operation.

A detailed Overview of all available Database operators and their respective JSON notation can be found at :ref:`jsonplanops`.

The second edge ["1","2"] will make Hyrise perfom a Projection on the result of the last edge. The syntax is quite straightforward here - you simply pass a list of all the columns to be projected. That would be "company_id" and "company_name" in this example.

To get a feel for json Query execution, go ahead and run the query above -> see :ref:`qexec` below.

Your response from the server should look something like this::

    {
      "header" : [ "company_id", "company_name" ],
      "performanceData" : [
        {
          "data" : 0,
          "duration" : 69,
          "endTime" : 2.6423050,
          "executingThread" : "0x7fcef2d006d0",
          "id" : "0",
          "name" : "TableLoad",
          "papi_event" : "PAPI_L1_DCA",
          "startTime" : 2.5683790
        }, 
                ...
      ],
      "rows" : 
      [
        [ 2, "Microsoft" ],
        [ 3, "SAP AG" ],
        [ 4, "Oracle" ]
      ]
    }


``"header"`` outputs the header for result table (=list of field names).

``"performanceData"`` gives detailed performance data.

    More specifically it returns performance data on each one the Plan Operations. Here: ``"name":"TableLoad"``, ``"name":"SimpleTableScan"`` and ``"name":"ProjectionScan"``.
    
    ``"id":`` and ``"name":`` are used respectively.
    
    ``"data":`` returns event counter for the measured PAPI event.
    
    ``"duration":`` refers to actual clock cycles required to run the operation.
    
    ``"startTime":`` and ``"endTime":`` give the start and end time of the operation in nanoseconds.
    
    ``"papi_event":`` specifies which Papi Event was used to measure performance.
    
    Additionally there is performance data available for the parsing of the JSON Query -> ``"name":"RequestParseTask"`` as well as for outputting the response -> ``"name":"ResponseTask"``.

``"rows"`` gives a list of the rows resulting from the query.


Settings
========

Currently, there is no designated scheduling unit implemented in HYRISE. To simulate scheduling or other decisions, a settings operation can be executed to set certain options::

	"ID": {
		"type": "SettingsOperation",
		"threadpoolSize": 2
		[, your additional options...]
	}

Options can be defined in the Settings data container using SettingsOperation. Use and/or implement additional operations to apply or set and apply them, like the ThreadpoolAdjustment operation::

	"ID": {
		"type": "ThreadpoolAdjustment",
		"size": 2
	}

Executing this operation will set threadpoolSize in Settings to 2 and instantly apply it on the boost threadpool.
