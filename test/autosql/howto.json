/*
 Files in this directory with the ending .json will be
 run and evaluated by src/bin/access/autosql.cpp.
 Queries in the "test"-field of this json object will be evaluated
 against the query specified in the "reference"-field.

 "test" is expected to be an SQL string or array of SQL strings, that will be executed.
 If it is an array, the result of the last string will be evaluated.

 "reference" can be either a SQL string or a JSON-query, which
 will be executed and compared with the result of "test"
